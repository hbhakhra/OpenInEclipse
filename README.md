Open In Eclipse
===============

Opens the current file being worked on in Eclipse. 

## How do I use it?

####Installation
Install using package control. See [package control docs](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage) for details.

####Setup
There is a setting specifying the path to eclipse. The default is "C:\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe". To use, override this path with the path to the eclipse you want to open the current files in. 

####Usage
Open command pallet and select "Open in Eclipse". This can also be mapped to a keyboard shortcut but it was intentionally not done to avoid shortcut collisions.
